## Guide for the values used to generate plots and datasets

File : "Nakagami_x_ky_mz" -> for plots generated by using only the method described in 1st paper

with x = 1 or 2 -> Paper followed,

     y >= 0     -> Value of KFactor for Rician fading Used

and  z >= 0.5   -> Value of m in Nakagami fading used.


File : "Nakagami_x_mz" or "Nakagami_x+y_mz" -> for plots generated by using the methods described in 1st and 2nd paper

with x = 1 or 2 -> Paper followed,

     y = 2      -> If method described in 2nd paper is used

and  z >= 0.5   -> Value of m in Nakagami fading used.
